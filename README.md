# Sudoku_Solver
The provided code is a Sudoku solver implemented in Python. It uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution for a given Sudoku board. The board is represented as a 2D list, where an empty cell is represented by -1.

The find_next_empty function finds the next empty cell in the board. It returns a tuple of the row and column indices of the empty cell. If there are no empty cells, it returns None, None.

The is_valid function checks if a given guess is valid for a particular cell in the board. It checks if the guess appears in the same row, column, or 3x3 grid as the current cell. If the guess is valid, it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

The solve_sudoko function is the main function that solves the Sudoku board. It uses a backtracking algorithm to try all possible guesses for the next empty cell. If a guess leads to a valid Sudoku board, it recursively calls solve_sudoko to solve the rest of the board. If no guess leads to a valid board, it backtracks and tries the next guess. If all guesses have been tried and none lead to a valid board, it returns False.

The if __name__ == '__main__': block at the end of the code is used to run the Sudoku solver on a given example board.

This will print True if the Sudoku board has a solution, and the solved Sudoku board. If the board has no solution, it will print False
